more than a about ten shadow recieving objects. The expense is the draw back
that the shadow Recieve mode set on spatial is ignored. So basically all and
only objects that render depth in the scene receive shadows. See this post

It utilizes the scene hierarchy, instead of making the huge flat geometries list first.
Instead of adding all geometries from scene to the RenderQueue.shadowCast and checking
all of them one by one against camera frustum the whole Node is checked first
to hopefully avoid the check on its children.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="../../../org/angle3d/shadow/PointLightShadowFilter.html">PointLightShadowFilter</a></td><td><p>This Filter does basically the same as a SpotLightShadowRenderer except it
